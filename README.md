# Design Process

The wireframe I made as a template to help me with my final web site:
https://xd.adobe.com/view/071594c6-7c54-4a84-8468-bb23fd1b46c2-5246/

This web site is made for the general audience and people who are looking for somewhere to eat. The home page includes the navigation bar, a small introduction of the company, the available promotions and the footer. The navigations are made to link to other web sites so user can access other websites with ease. The small introduction of the company is to tell new visitors what are the contents to be expected in the website. The promotions are set to immediately get the audience attention because who does not like discounts, right? As a customer who cares about conserving money, I'd want a discount, hence putting the promotions on the front page. I also would care about ease of access, so therefore, a navigation bar throughout the website would be very helpful.

Second page:

This is just to showcase the specials on the website and food menu to the visitors. As a customer visiting a food website, of course I'd want to see the food served here.

Third page:
https://xd.adobe.com/view/071594c6-7c54-4a84-8468-bb23fd1b46c2-5246/screen/e943b1d1-f286-48db-8837-9994b0cabaaa/

This to show a small information of the company. This is crucial to make visitors find the restaurant more credible. A user would want at least want to know more about the company. Hence, this webpage.

Fourth page:
https://xd.adobe.com/view/071594c6-7c54-4a84-8468-bb23fd1b46c2-5246/screen/639b799a-5c7e-4c00-85da-f68cc82a9306/

This is the reservation form so that users/customers can interact and book seats for themselves.

Fifth page:https://xd.adobe.com/view/071594c6-7c54-4a84-8468-bb23fd1b46c2-5246/screen/2ecfcae7-5bd9-4be9-8cf3-4f6941fae5da/

This is the contact page with additional contact information about the restaurant. In the senario where a customer wants to get an equiry, this would allow the customer to get in touch with the restaurant.

The rest of the wireframe design are mobile layouts of the same thing.
